# Assignment 1

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Assignment 1 in a Jupyter Notebook.  
The implementation and results of the first assignment for the Deep
Learning for Social Analytics module. The Assignment consists of three parts. (1) building a
custom PV-DBOW Doc2Vec model, (2) implementing a feedforward Neural Network for text
classification on the given dataset, and (3) improving the performance of Neural Network by
groupingthesecategoriesintoasmallersetofclasses. Thereportincludestheimplementation
of Doc2Vec using negative sampling and a significant improvement in classification accuracy
(from∼59% to∼87%) after grouping the target categories.
